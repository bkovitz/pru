\maketitle

The examples in this document generate and capture PWM pulses on the PRU.
This is probably not the best way to do PWM on an ARM-334x processor: it has a
built-in PWM unit for that. However, using the PRU to perform PWM does
illustrate real-time programming on a very simple but highly timing-sensitive
example.

The PRU does not support interrupts. Interrupts would complicate real-time
processing and make response times unpredictable. Instead, the PRU must poll
sources of interrupts. The documentation still calls them ``interrupts'' and 
the PRU has an ``interrupt controller'' (INTC) to track and prioritize them.
