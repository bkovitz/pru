This is a simple (as in, "hello world"-level) program to help you get started
with programming the AM335x PRU_ICSS on the BeagleBone Black. (It's very
specific to that platform.)

I've got a web page up that explains all this in way more detail:

   http://mythopoeic.org/bbb-pru-minimal

The TL;DR version:

1) To build, just type "make". (You have to have pasm in your $PATH,
the prussdrv library headers in /usr/include/pruss/ and the prussdrv
libraries in /usr/lib/ for it to work as-is.)

2) Make sure the PRU is enabled. Minimal command (as root):

   echo BB-BONE-PRU-01 >/sys/devices/bone_capemgr.9/slots

3) Run as root:

   sudo ./example

If it's working correctly, you should see output like:

waiting for interrupt from PRU0...
PRU program completed, event number 1

It should take ~5 seconds between the first line and the second. The event
number will increase each time you run it.
